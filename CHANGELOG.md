# Changelog

All notable changes to the Z2M Irrigation integration will be documented in this file.

## [1.0.1] - 2025-10-20

### üêõ Critical Fixes

#### Volume-Based Runs Not Stopping
- **FIXED**: Added automatic valve shutoff when target liters reached
  - Integration now actively monitors flow and turns off valve when target is reached
  - Prevents overwatering that was occurring in v1.0.0
  - Added detailed logging when volume target is reached

#### Native Device Commands Not Supported
- **CONFIRMED**: Sonoff SWV's timer/volume features not exposed via Zigbee2MQTT
  - Z2M logs show: "No converter available for 'water_consumed'" and "'timer'"
  - Removed unsupported native command attempts
  - All control now handled by Home Assistant (more reliable!)

#### Flow Conversion Clarified
- **DOCUMENTED**: Device reports flow in m¬≥/h, not L/min
  - Conversion: 1 m¬≥/h = 16.667 L/min
  - `flow_scale` is a user multiplier (default 1.0)

### Technical Details from Z2M Logs

Testing revealed the Sonoff SWV:
1. Reports `"flow"` in m¬≥/h (e.g., 0.7, 0.6, 0.5)
2. Does NOT support `water_consumed` parameter
3. Does NOT support `timer`, `irrigation_time`, or `duration` parameters
4. HAS `cyclic_quantitative_irrigation` fields but not controllable via Z2M

### How It Works Now

**Volume Runs:**
1. Valve turns ON via simple MQTT
2. HA monitors flow every 2-4 seconds
3. Calculates liters: `(flow_m3h √ó 16.667 √∑ 60) √ó seconds`
4. Turns OFF when target reached
5. Overshoot: ~0.1-0.2L (reaction time)

**Timed Runs:**
1. Valve turns ON
2. HA timer set for duration
3. Timer expires ‚Üí OFF
4. Accuracy: ¬±1 second

**‚ö†Ô∏è Upgrade immediately if using volume-based irrigation!**

## [1.0.0] - 2025-10-20

### üéâ Major Release

Complete rewrite with enhanced features and local database integration.

### ‚ú® Added

- **Session Duration Sensor** - Track how long the current irrigation session has been running
- **Dual Remaining Sensors** - Separate sensors for remaining time and remaining liters with smart estimates
- **Native Zigbee Control** - Commands sent directly to device for offline operation
  - Timed runs use device's built-in timer
  - Volume runs use device's built-in water meter
- **Local Database Integration** - Session history stored in Home Assistant's recorder (no cloud required)
- **Battery Level Sensor** - Monitor valve battery status
- **Link Quality Sensor** - Track Zigbee signal strength
- **Session Count Sensor** - Total number of irrigation sessions
- **Number Entities** - Easy-to-use controls for setting run duration and volume
- **Enhanced Documentation** - Comprehensive README and installation guide

### üîß Changed

- **Unit Conversion Fixed** - Properly converts m¬≥/h to L/min (multiply by 16.667)
- **Flow Rate Accuracy** - Corrected flow rate calculations for Sonoff SWV devices
- **Threading Issues Resolved** - Fixed all async/await patterns to prevent event loop errors
- **Session Tracking Improved** - Better session start/end detection and logging
- **Reset Service Enhanced** - Now also resets session count

### üóëÔ∏è Removed

- **Supabase Dependency** - Replaced with native Home Assistant database
- **Cloud Dependencies** - All data stored locally
- **Unnecessary Files** - Cleaned up non-integration files from repository

### üìä Technical Improvements

- Home Assistant recorder integration for long-term statistics
- Proper async/await patterns throughout codebase
- Better error handling and logging
- Optimized MQTT message processing
- Improved device discovery reliability

### üìö Documentation

- Complete README with features, installation, and troubleshooting
- Detailed installation guide with HACS and manual methods
- Service examples and usage patterns
- Dashboard customization examples
- Troubleshooting section with common issues

## [0.9.2] - Previous Version

### Features

- Basic valve control via MQTT
- Flow rate monitoring
- Session tracking
- Total usage counters
- Timed run support
- Volume run support

---

## Migration from 0.9.x to 1.0.0

### Breaking Changes

None - this version is fully backward compatible!

### What You Get

After upgrading, you'll see these new entities per valve:
- `sensor.{valve}_session_duration`
- `sensor.{valve}_remaining_time`
- `sensor.{valve}_remaining_liters`
- `sensor.{valve}_battery`
- `sensor.{valve}_link_quality`
- `sensor.{valve}_session_count`
- `number.{valve}_run_for_minutes`
- `number.{valve}_run_for_liters`

Old entities remain unchanged:
- `switch.{valve}_valve`
- `sensor.{valve}_flow`
- `sensor.{valve}_session_used`
- `sensor.{valve}_total`
- `sensor.{valve}_total_minutes`

### Upgrade Steps

1. Update via HACS or replace files manually
2. Restart Home Assistant
3. All new sensors will appear automatically
4. Update your dashboards to include new entities
5. Session history starts logging immediately
