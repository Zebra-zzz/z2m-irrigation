# Changelog

All notable changes to the Z2M Irrigation integration will be documented in this file.

## [3.0.0] - 2025-11-01

### üéâ MAJOR RELEASE - 100% Local Persistence

#### Bug Fixes (Latest)
- Fixed MQTT connection timing issue on startup (graceful handling if MQTT not ready)
- Fixed `async_add_entities` TypeError (removed incorrect await statements)
- Fixed missing `_LOGGER` import in `__init__.py`
- Fixed SQLite concurrent access issues by enabling WAL mode
- Fixed SQLite cursor management - all cursors now properly closed after use
- Integration now loads successfully even if MQTT connects after integration startup

#### Breaking Changes
- **Removed Supabase cloud dependency** - All data now stored locally in SQLite
- **Scheduler temporarily disabled** - Smart schedules require database migration (coming in v3.1.0)
  - Manual watering via services (`start_liters`, `start_timed`) works perfectly
  - Use automations for scheduling in the meantime
- No more .env file needed
- No more external configuration
- Fully local, no internet required

#### New Features

**Local SQLite Database**
- All irrigation data stored in `/config/z2m_irrigation.db`
- Automatic initialization on startup
- Survives all Home Assistant restarts
- Auto-cleanup of old sessions (>90 days)
- Included in Home Assistant backups automatically

**4 New Time-Based Sensors Per Valve**
- `sensor.xxx_last_24h` - Liters used in last 24 hours
- `sensor.xxx_last_24h_minutes` - Runtime in last 24 hours
- `sensor.xxx_last_7_days` - Liters used in last 7 days
- `sensor.xxx_last_7_days_minutes` - Runtime in last 7 days

**Universal Session Tracking**
- Tracks ALL valve usage regardless of trigger source:
  - Integration service calls
  - Manual switch toggles
  - Automations
  - Z2M manual control
  - Physical valve button
- Rolling time windows (24h, 7d) update after every session
- Complete history preserved

#### Improvements
- Faster startup (no external API calls)
- Better reliability (no network dependency)
- Simpler setup (no cloud configuration)
- Enhanced debug logging with emojis
- Better performance with indexed queries

#### Migration
- Existing data from v2.x not migrated (fresh start)
- All sensors remain compatible
- No configuration changes needed
- Just restart Home Assistant!

## [2.0.0] - 2025-10-20

### üéâ MAJOR RELEASE - Smart Scheduling System

#### New Features: Irrigation Scheduling

**Time-Based Schedules**
- Create schedules that run at specific times (e.g., 6:00 AM, 6:00 PM)
- Select specific days of the week or run daily
- Set duration (minutes) or volume (liters) targets
- Enable/disable schedules without deleting them

**Interval-Based Schedules**
- Run valves every X hours automatically
- Perfect for frequent watering needs
- Tracks last run time automatically

**Smart Conditions (Weather-Aware)**
- Skip if soil moisture is too high (sensor integration)
- Skip based on temperature ranges (weather integration)
- Skip if it rained recently (weather integration)
- Conditions are optional - simple schedules work too!

**Database Backend**
- All schedules stored in Supabase
- Schedule run history tracked automatically
- View why schedules were skipped (conditions, manual, etc.)
- Link schedule runs to irrigation sessions

#### New Services

- `z2m_irrigation.create_schedule` - Create new schedule
- `z2m_irrigation.update_schedule` - Modify existing schedule
- `z2m_irrigation.delete_schedule` - Remove schedule
- `z2m_irrigation.enable_schedule` - Enable schedule
- `z2m_irrigation.disable_schedule` - Disable schedule
- `z2m_irrigation.run_schedule_now` - Trigger schedule immediately
- `z2m_irrigation.reload_schedules` - Reload from database

#### WebSocket API

- `z2m_irrigation/schedules/list` - Get all schedules
- `z2m_irrigation/schedules/get` - Get specific schedule
- `z2m_irrigation/schedules/runs` - Get schedule run history

#### Architecture Changes

- New `scheduler.py` module handles all scheduling logic
- Checks for due schedules every minute
- Automatic next-run-time calculation
- Priority system for overlapping schedules
- Thread-safe execution

**Breaking Changes:**
- `hass.data[DOMAIN][entry_id]` now returns `{"manager": ..., "scheduler": ...}` instead of just the manager

---

## [1.0.3] - 2025-10-20

### üö® CRITICAL - Threading Fixes

#### Thread Safety Violations Fixed
- **FIXED**: All threading violations causing Home Assistant crashes
  - Added `_schedule_task()` helper for thread-safe async task scheduling
  - Fixed `_on_state()` MQTT callback to use `call_soon_threadsafe()`
  - Added `@callback` decorator to all entity update callbacks
  - Entities (sensor/switch/number) now update safely from dispatcher signals

#### Failsafes Now Actually Work
- **CONFIRMED**: Failsafes detected 12L/5L overflow and tried to stop valve
  - Previous threading errors prevented OFF command from executing
  - Now properly sends OFF command when targets exceeded
  - Uses thread-safe task scheduling

**Critical upgrade**: v1.0.2 had the logic but threading bugs prevented execution. v1.0.3 actually works!

---

## [1.0.2] - 2025-10-20

### üêõ Critical Fixes - Device Quirk Discovered

#### Device Clears Native Volume Commands
- **DISCOVERED**: Sonoff SWV clears `cyclic_quantitative_irrigation` immediately after starting
  - Z2M logs show: device accepts command, sets `current_count:1`, valve turns ON
  - Then immediately: `irrigation_capacity:0, total_number:0` (program cleared!)
  - **Solution**: Use simple ON/OFF + HA monitoring for volume runs
  - Timed runs: Testing needed to see if `cyclic_timed_irrigation` has same issue

#### Failsafe System Fixes
- **FIXED**: Failsafes now check on EVERY MQTT update, not just during flow integration
  - Volume failsafe now triggers even if flow stops or is zero
  - Time failsafe now checks anytime valve is ON with a target time
  - Added progress logging (DEBUG level) to track volume runs
  - Failsafes clear targets after triggering to prevent repeated OFF commands

#### Switch State Delay
- **DOCUMENTED**: Switch entity updates when Z2M publishes state, not instantly
  - This is normal Zigbee behavior (device ‚Üí coordinator ‚Üí Z2M ‚Üí MQTT ‚Üí HA)
  - Typical delay: 1-3 seconds
  - State eventually syncs correctly

---

## [1.0.1] - 2025-10-20

### üêõ Critical Fixes

#### Volume-Based Runs Not Stopping
- **FIXED**: Added automatic valve shutoff when target liters reached
  - Integration now actively monitors flow and turns off valve when target is reached
  - Prevents overwatering that was occurring in v1.0.0
  - Added detailed logging when volume target is reached

#### Native Device Commands Fixed
- **CORRECTED**: Now using proper `cyclic_quantitative_irrigation` and `cyclic_timed_irrigation` objects
  - Previous attempts used wrong parameters: `water_consumed`, `timer` (not supported)
  - Now using correct Z2M API per device documentation
  - Device will handle shutoff natively + HA backup monitoring as failsafe

#### Flow Conversion Clarified
- **DOCUMENTED**: Device reports flow in m¬≥/h, not L/min
  - Conversion: 1 m¬≥/h = 16.667 L/min
  - `flow_scale` is a user multiplier (default 1.0)

### Technical Details

**What Was Wrong:**
- Using `{"state": "ON", "water_consumed": 6000}` ‚ùå (Z2M: "No converter available")
- Using `{"state": "ON", "timer": 360}` ‚ùå (Z2M: "No converter available")

**What's Correct:**
- Volume: `{"cyclic_quantitative_irrigation": {"current_count": 0, "total_number": 1, "irrigation_capacity": 6, "irrigation_interval": 0}}` ‚úÖ
- Timed: `{"cyclic_timed_irrigation": {"current_count": 0, "total_number": 1, "irrigation_duration": 360, "irrigation_interval": 0}}` ‚úÖ

### How It Works Now - Triple Failsafe System

**Volume Runs (3 layers of protection):**
1. **Native Device Control**: `cyclic_quantitative_irrigation` command tells device to stop at target
2. **Real-time Monitoring**: HA checks every MQTT update if `session_liters >= target_liters`
3. **Forced Shutoff**: If target exceeded, HA sends OFF command immediately (logged as WARNING)

**Timed Runs (3 layers of protection):**
1. **Native Device Control**: `cyclic_timed_irrigation` command tells device to stop at target time
2. **Real-time Monitoring**: HA checks every MQTT update if `now >= session_end_ts`
3. **Backup Timer**: HA timer fires at exact target time and forces OFF if still running (logged as WARNING)

**Result**: Even if the device completely fails, HA will ALWAYS turn off the valve when targets are reached.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Upgrade immediately if using volume-based irrigation!**
